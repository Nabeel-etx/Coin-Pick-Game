# Coin-Pick-Game
This is a very simple 2-player game made on CodeSandBox. 
It is inspired by a really old interview question I read once.

Question (not exactly): There is a basket full of coins, each player can only pick 1-5 coins at a time. 
Last person to pick loses the game. Write a solution to display winner of this game. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
There are two players, A and B, wait for your letter box to turn BLUE then collect coins.
Number of coins in the basket at the start is a random number in the range(10-50).

Rules:
Pick a number, [1-5], such that you are not the last person to pick.


ENJOY!
